# Modeling Irreversible Soil Degradation and Rehabilitation with the Preisach Framework

This GitHub repository corresponds to the published article *cite*. The repistory contains:

  * Widgets designed to give users an intuitive sense of how the Preisach framework works.
  * A guide to parameterizing the model using experimental data.

## Widgets

##### 1. Geometric Intepretation of the Preisach Framework

This widget demonstrates how hysterons, the core of the Preisach framework, are used to model hysteresis. To run the widget, click the <em>Launch Binder</em>. Wait for the notebook to load (this can take several minutes) and then click <em>Cell --> Run All</em>.

##### 2. The Weight Function

In this widget we demonstrate how weight functions affect the system's output. With this widget, the user can compare different weight functions, including how each affects output. To run the widget, click the <em>Launch Binder</em>. Wait for the notebook to load (this can take several minutes) and then click <em>Cell --> Run All</em>.

## Finding a soil's weight function  

In this notebook, we demonstrate how experimental data can be used to find a soil's weight function, as in Section 2.3 of the article. To run the notebook, click the Launch Binder. Wait for the notebook to load (this can take several minutes) and then click Cell --> Run All.
