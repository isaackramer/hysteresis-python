# hysteresis-python
I opened this branch for uploading the new version, didnt want to make any changes in the master for my first time here.
Anyway I made some few changes:
Change in 263 - Fixing the error of the reset button, the explanation is in the code
Change in 99 - till now when u input gets back to 0 we have the p. triangle with value of 1 at the first column. I just forced it to be 0 
so that p. triangle's display would be a whole gray and not partial black in the margin as it was before. 
change in 184 - making the p. triangle axe square
